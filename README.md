# About Me

I’m a B.Tech Computer Science (AI & ML) student at  
Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering (SCTCE), Trivandrum.

I learn by building. Most of my understanding comes from experimenting, breaking systems, and rebuilding them better. I focus on practical skills and real-world engineering rather than just academic theory.

My interests span AI/ML, robotics, system internals, and full-stack development. I aim to build production-ready projects and continuously improve my depth as an engineer.
